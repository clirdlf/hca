                The program will focus on description, processing, and digitising hidden and at-risk materials held at collecting organizations in Africa. The program design will be refined in consultation with an advisory committee, made up of experts from different regions of Africa and beyond.</p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                The program draws from CLIR's existing regranting programs and would be designed with local considerations in mind. Hidden Collections Africa will be organized around open  competitions with selections determined by an independent review panel. In the initial
                years, the program may limit eligibility by region, rotating geographic focus by
                program cycle.</p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                Hidden Collections Africa would group applicants into three pools by region: 1) Southern and Eastern Africa, 2) Central and West Africa, and 3) North Africa. The project will cover the four main languages: English, French, Arabic, and Portuguese collections, as well as indigenous African languages aligned with the regional focus of each cycle.

            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                Open digital access to the collections and related resources would be encouraged, but
                not required, given the complexities around international intellectual property laws,
                particularly with recorded collections, and respecting diverse cultures. Flexibility
                around access requirements would also minimize the risks of the exploitation of
                sensitive materials and the records of marginalized communities. Preservation
                requirements of these unique collections is also critical. Therefore, factoring in and
                understanding preservation needs, for example, identifying paper types of lower
                quality, will allow prioritization of higher-risk collection materials.

                To ensure sustainability of the project and other cascade positive effects, the project
                will support technical skills building and exchange. This will boost the number of
                African based professionals who are able to continue with digitisation processes and
                implementation in the future. In line with the global UN Sustainable Development
                Goals, this project will foster South to South and South to North partnerships and help
                extend the networks of professionals across the continent. The project also
                strengthens connections between African cultural organizations and the communities
                in the African diaspora.
