<h2>What is Hidden Collections Africa?</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.clir.org" target="_blank">Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)</a> 
  proposes a new grant program to digitally preserve collections, promoting history and scholarship
  while decolonising knowledge spaces for Africa. This will be achieved by
  describing and digitising materials at organisations in Africa that are
  inaccessible or at risk of being lost forever. The initiative draws
  inspiration from CLIR's large-scale grant programs, including <a href="https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections">Digitizing
  Hidden Special Collections and Archives</a>. Led by African-based professionals,
  the new proposed program, Hidden Collections Africa, would directly support
  institutions and staff across the African continent to meet urgent
  preservation needs, close gaps in the historical record, and make records more
  accessible to users.
</p>

<h2>Why is it needed?</h2>
<p>
  The
  <a
    href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"
    target="_blank"
    >Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a
  >
  asserts that access to information is a universal human right. It underpins
  social justice and facilitates informed decision making for planning,
  research, and development of humanity. In the 21st century, the availability
  of digital information has eased access to information for many. However,
  globally, Africa has the lowest number of accessible and available
  collections, both digital and print. Less than four percent of Africa’s
  collections are available digitally. The limited availability of digital
  resources about and by Africans hinders egalitarian access to information and
  knowledge advancement on the continent. This is evidenced by duplication in
  research, inaccurate research conclusions, misguided policies, and the
  exclusion of some communities in research agendas. It also reduces the
  authenticity of history and intergenerational knowledge sharing.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, collecting organizations in Africa face a number of urgent
  preservation challenges due to climate change and ongoing legacies of colonial
  exploitation. Rising sea levels, extreme heat, and aberrant weather patterns
  are on track to displace millions of people over the next several decades,
  increasing conflict and instability. Climate disasters, including fires,
  floods, desertification, and drought, threaten to obliterate these
  collections, some of which have
  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01045-4"
    >already been lost</a
  >. Inventories and digital copies of collections are important safeguards to
  ensure that some versions of the materials held in African repositories will
  remain available for future generations.
</p>

<p>
  Africa’s collections are mainly available in oral and traditional hard copy
  formats. This has been due to a lack of resources, both human skills and
  infrastructure. Critical holdings in need of digitization include content
  related to political movements and leadership, climate and environment, women
  and gender, indigenous languages, and innumerable other topics. Equitable
  access to these African collections will help inform decisions in civil
  society, religious groups, and other related communities.
</p>

<h2>How would it work?</h2>
<p>
  The program, as currently conceived, would focus on description, processing,
  and digitising hidden and at-risk materials held at collecting organizations
  in Africa. The program design will be refined in consultation with an advisory
  committee, made up of experts from different regions of Africa and beyond. The
  program draws from CLIR’s existing regranting programs and would be designed
  with local considerations in mind. As with CLIR’s other programs, this one
  would be organized around open competitions, with selections determined by an
  independent review panel. In the initial years, the program may limit
  eligibility by region, rotating geographic focus by program cycle. Hidden
  Collections Africa would group applicants into three pools
  <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/" target="_blank"
    >by region</a
  >: 1) Southern and Eastern Africa, 2) Central and West Africa, and 3) North
  Africa. The project will cover the four main languages: English, French,
  Arabic, and Portuguese collections, as well as indigenous African languages
  aligned with the regional focus of each cycle.
</p>

<p>
  Open digital access to the collections and related resources would be
  encouraged, but not required, given the complexities around international
  intellectual property laws, particularly with recorded collections, and
  respecting diverse cultures. Flexibility around access requirements would also
  minimize the risks of the exploitation of sensitive materials and the records
  of marginalized communities. Preservation requirements of these unique
  collections is also critical. Therefore, factoring in and understanding
  preservation needs, for example, identifying paper types of lower quality,
  will allow prioritization of higher-risk collection materials.
</p>

<p>
  To ensure sustainability of the project and other cascade positive effects,
  the project will support technical skills building and exchange. This will
  boost the number of African based professionals who are able to continue with
  digitisation processes and implementation in the future. In line with the
  global UN Sustainable Development Goals, this project will foster South to
  South and South to North partnerships and help extend the networks of
  professionals across the continent. The project also strengthens connections
  between African cultural organizations and the communities in the African
  diaspora.
