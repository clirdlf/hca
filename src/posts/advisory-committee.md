To this end, we have developed a rubric to assit with the recruitment of individuals that takes into account a candidate's personal and professional background, technical and subject expertise, experience working in Africa and connections to national and regional networks. 

## Rubric

* **Personal Background**: This is the expertise an individual brings to the project. This will have a medium weight as there may be individuals who do not have titles, but do have experience in other areas (e.g. information science, history, etc) to make them a compelling advisor to the project.
* **Profession**: This is the professional background of the individual. It does not necessarily have to be limited to Library and Information Science. Career position, level, and Employer. Medium (certain individuals might not have information science qualifications but experience with and in information science history and other related areas).
* **Technical Expertise**: Technical expertise in digitization and other related professional areas. Higher (This is crucial as there needs to be input from technical expertise in digitization)
* **Subject Expertise**: This includes the areas of expertise by subject. It also includes Intellectual Property and Copyright law specialization. Higher (Subject matter experts are crucial as they help in reviewing rare and hidden collections, as well as any gaps)
* **Experience with Africa**: This is the working, research, or personal  experience of the individual in and with Africa. It also includes regional or community expertise and
expertise with cultural heritage and information resources in Africa. Priority will be given to individuals who are African or of African descent. Higher (This is important to enable an understanding of the submissions, identifying gaps and work approaches for each region)
* **Access to national and regional networks e.g. associations** Accessibility to and participation in national networks such as associations is considered. The goal is for reviewers and advisers to have experience working with different types of communities in Africa, and who can help the program make connections with important stakeholders. Higher (This is one of the most important factors, as networking is at the heart of the future potential of digitizing Africa’s hidden collections)
* **Alignment of values**: Does the professional have a work history and philosophy that demonstrate alignment with the program's values (e.g. decolonizing knowledge spaces)? Medium (This is important as advisors will help determine the program’s final form, which must be consistent with its values. It is also helpful to have  some members who understand CLIR’s existing programming and who have institutional memory to help with the processes and align with the values).
