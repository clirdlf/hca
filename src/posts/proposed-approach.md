# Key Ideas

* Working at scale within the African continent (rather than project-by-project or country-by-country) is essential for addressing the imbalance between digital cultural heritage sourced within and outside Africa.
* Relying on Africa-based leadership will keep the responsibility for setting priorities within Africa.
Focusing on local capacity building will help ensure longer term preservation of project outcomes and extend the program’s reach beyond the terms of individual digitisation projects.
* Facilitating international connections both within and outside Africa will help maximise awareness and use of resources digitised through HCA.
* Building upon existing Arcadia Foundation and CLIR initiatives will help set up already established policies and mechanisms quickly for testing in African contexts.

## Technical

Rather than a single prescribed approach for all participants, we would recommend a range of options for approaches to capture ([FADGI 3 star system](https://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/FADGI%20Federal%20%20Agencies%20Digital%20Guidelines%20Initiative-2016%20Final_rev1.pdf)), access strategy (see [Levels of Born Digital Access](https://osf.io/hqmy4)), metadata creation, content management/hosting (onsite/offsite), and digital preservation (see [Levels of Digital Preservation](https://osf.io/36xfy)). 

Participants could tailor their approach to their own collections and circumstances, working with the advice and access to training provided by program partners. A default low-cost option would be available from the program’s technical partner, UbuntuNet Alliance, through their National and Research Education Network (NREN) service nodes. UbuntuNet would provide technical training for applicants and recipients while offering digital content management and digital preservation solutions for recipients without local capacity based on open source software platforms.

# Stakeholder Engagement

While not part of the core program, program partners will also seek funding for parallel initiatives that help broaden and deepen the impact of funded projects on the creation and sharing of knowledge will be critical to its success. Here are 3 areas of anticipated work: a librarian exchange program, convenings, and digital and physical repatriation. AAU and HBCU-LA will be key partners in these areas. Building upon existing programs led by partner organisations, parallel initiatives would include student/librarian/faculty exchanges, shared online information literacy and training curricula targeted to students and faculty, and conferences and events to celebrate and share knowledge outcomes.
