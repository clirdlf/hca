It is with deep sadness that we mourn the passing of Nodumo Dhlamini, Director of ICT and Knowledge Management for the Association of African Universities and a valued collaborator on the Hidden Collections Africa project. She passed suddenly on Friday, April 25, 2025 following a brief surgical procedure.

Nodumo brought exceptional dedication, vision, and warmth to every initiative she touched. Through her leadership, she championed innovation in knowledge management and the advancement of higher education across Africa. Her support, generosity, and guidance have been instrumental to the development of Hidden Collections Africa, where her belief in the power of accessible knowledge inspired us all.

Beyond her professional contributions, Nodumo was a generous friend; someone whose passion, kindness, and tireless spirit left a lasting mark on everyone who had the privilege to work alongside her. 

We extend our deepest condolences to her family, her colleagues at the AAU, and all who mourn her loss. We honor her memory and celebrate the enduring legacy she leaves behind in the communities she served with excellence.
