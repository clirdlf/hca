The approach expands the idea of infrastructure beyond its technical dimensions. Includes people, systems, knowledge. Program to be developed not just to implement new technologies and increase access to original source content but also to empower people to steward and engage with that content

## Generative Sustainability

The approach expands the idea of sustainability beyond its financial dimensions to both technical and especially social actions. Includes local capacity, long term digital preservation, broad awareness, and ensuring ongoing use. For the purposes of HC Africa, partnering with exemplary institutions of higher education in both Africa and the US would facilitate the more generative, reproducible and extensible aspects of sustainability that include teaching, research, training, exhibiting, organising, and related methods of engagement that promote continuity of effort across generations.

## Community-Centered Access

In order to digitally capture and share the broadest possible range of content, the proposed approach is to emphasise community-centred access, a core value of CLIR’s existing hidden collections initiative.
This is defined as "approaches to access, description, and outreach that make digitised content as widely available and useful as possible within legal and ethical constraints, centering digital inclusion and respect for materials’ local contexts."

While the default recommended approach will be completely open access to both metadata and high-resolution digital content, applicants will be allowed to customise plans best suited to their own capacity, context and collections, and to commit to carrying out the access plans they propose, if funded.
