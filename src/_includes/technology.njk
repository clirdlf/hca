        CLIR has worked closely with Stanford University Libraries to develop an extensible technology stack to quickly build a discovery and interpretative interface for distributed collections. With a proven implementation through the <a target="_blank" href="https://dlmenetwork.org/library">Digital Library of the Middle East</a>, this open source solution builds upon several best-in-class open source projects amking it scalable and adaptable to different needs and includes a content management system, a metadata repository, a search engine, and interpretive tools that can be easily configured to handl multiple languages.

        Not only would newly digitized collections be discoverable through this system, but already digitized collections could be easily incorporated into the discovery as well. The approach of the discovery is meant to drive users to where the information is being maintained, but standardize metadata discovery, search across collections, provide additional interpretive resources (such as essages, images, and videos to help user understand collections), and link collections to other relevant collections such as online exhibits and scholarly articles. The technology stack developed for the Digital Library of the Middle East is a powerful tool that can be used to make Hidden Collections in Africa more accessible and understandable. By using this technology, we can help to preserve and share these important cultural resources for future generations.
