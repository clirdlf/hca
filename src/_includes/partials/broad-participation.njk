                    True progress and innovation arise from the fusion of different viewpoints, and this fusion only becomes possible within a deliberately inclusive environment in which voices that have historically been marginalized or underrepresented are not just heard, but celebrated.

                    The program aims to eventually span the entire continent of Africa and offer applications and applicant support in four languages: English, French, Arabic, and Portuguese. Our partnerships with <a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntunet.net/">Ubuntunet</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://aau.org/">Association of African Universities</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rfnum.org/pages/">Réseau francophone numérique (RFN)-AISBL</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://hbculibraries.org/">HBCU Library Alliance</a> enable us to recruit input, applications, and advisory committee members from a geographically and academically diverse constituency. Drawing on lessons learned from CLIR's administration of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections/">Digitizing Hidden Collections: Amplifying Unheard Voices program</a>, program, we will provide an accessible application process and ongoing grantee support to ensure that less-resourced organizations can succeed. Grant applicants will be invited to share how creating online access to their collections will make possible a richer and more complete understanding of the human experience.
