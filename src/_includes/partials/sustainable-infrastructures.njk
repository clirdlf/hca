                    Sustainable infrastructures require that any approach to the development of technologies or systems be rooted in a responsibility to the environment, society, and the global community. We prioritize strategies that can realistically be maintained over time and that minimize negative impacts on limited natural, economic, or socio-cultural resources.

                    The program will incorporate training, skill building, and capacity investments for applicants, recipients, and partner organizations. The goal is to leave our grantees equipped to continue the work of preserving, describing, and sharing African scholarship within Africa and around the world. Initially, the program's technical needs will be overseen by <a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntunet.net/">UbuntuNet</a>, a membership organization of National Research and Education Networks (<strong>NRENs</strong>) in Southern and Eastern Africa.
