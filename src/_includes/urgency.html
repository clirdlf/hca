                    Collecting organisations in Africa face a number of urgent preservation challenges due to climate change and ongoing legacies of colonial exploitation. Rising sea levels, extreme heat, and aberrant weather patterns are on track to displace millions of people over the next several decades. Climate disasters, including fires, floods, desertification, and drought, threaten to obliterate these collections, some of which have already been lost. What the fires do not burn, the floods drown.
