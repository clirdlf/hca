            <p class="lead">
                <strong>Hidden Collections Africa</strong> is a proposed new grant program by the <a href="https://www.clir.org" target="_blank">Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)</a> aimed at the digital preservation of collections, preservation of history and scholarhsip, and decolonisation of knowledge spaces for Africa. This program will focus on describing and digitizing materials at organizations in Africa that are at inaccessible, or at risk of being lost forever.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Led by African-based professionals, the program draws inspiration from CLIR's <a href="https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections">large-scale grant programs</a> and will directly support institutions and staff across the continent to meet urgent preservation needs, close gabs in the historical record, and make records more accessible to users.

            <p class="lead mb-3 lh-lg">
                The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights" target="_blank">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> asserts that access to information is a universal human right. It underpins social justice and facilitates informed decision making for planning, research, and development of humanity. In the 21st century, the availability of digital information has eased access to information for many. However, globally, Africa has the lowest number of accessible and available collections, both digital and print. Less than four percent of Africa's collections are available digitally. The limited availability of digital resources about and by Africans hinders egalitarian access to information and knowledge advancement on the continent. This is evidenced by duplication in research, inaccurate research conclusions, misguided policies, and the exclusion of some communities in research agendas. It also reduces the authenticity of history and intergenerational knowledge sharing. 
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                Meanwhile, collecting organizations in Africa face a number of urgent preservation challenges due to climate change and ongoing legacies of colonial exploitation. Rising sea levels, extreme heat, and aberrant weather patterns are on track to displace millions of people over the next several decades, increasing conflict and instability. Climate disasters, including fires, floods, desertification, and drought, threaten to obliterate these collections, some of which have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01045-4">already been lost</a>. Inventories and digital copies of collections are important safeguards to ensure that some versions of the materials held in African repositories will remain available for future generations.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                Africa's collections are mainly available in oral and traditional hard copy formats. This has been due to a lack of resources, both human skills and infrastructure. Critical holdings in need of digitization include content related to political movements and leadership, climate and environment, women and gender, indigenous languages, and innumerable other topics. Equitable access to these African collections will help inform decisions in civil society, religious groups, and other related communities.

            <h1 id="#why-is-it-needed" class="display-4 fw-bold pb-5 lh-1">How it would work?</h1>
            <p class="lead mb-3 lh-lg">
                The program will focus on description, processing, and digitising hidden and at-risk materials held at collecting organizations in Africa. The program design will be refined in consultation with an advisory committee, made up of experts from different regions of Africa and beyond.</p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                The program draws from CLIR's existing regranting programs and would be designed with local considerations in mind. Hidden Collections Africa will be organized around open  competitions with selections determined by an independent review panel. In the initial
                years, the program may limit eligibility by region, rotating geographic focus by
                program cycle.</p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                Hidden Collections Africa would group applicants into three pools by region: 1) Southern and Eastern Africa, 2) Central and West Africa, and 3) North Africa. The project will cover the four main languages: English, French, Arabic, and Portuguese collections, as well as indigenous African languages aligned with the regional focus of each cycle.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                Open digital access to the collections and related resources would be encouraged, but
                not required, given the complexities around international intellectual property laws,
                particularly with recorded collections, and respecting diverse cultures. Flexibility
                around access requirements would also minimize the risks of the exploitation of
                sensitive materials and the records of marginalized communities. Preservation
                requirements of these unique collections is also critical. Therefore, factoring in and
                understanding preservation needs, for example, identifying paper types of lower
                quality, will allow prioritization of higher-risk collection materials.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                To ensure sustainability of the project and other cascade positive effects, the project
                will support technical skills building and exchange. This will boost the number of
                African based professionals who are able to continue with digitisation processes and
                implementation in the future. In line with the global UN Sustainable Development
                Goals, this project will foster South to South and South to North partnerships and help
                extend the networks of professionals across the continent. The project also
                strengthens connections between African cultural organizations and the communities
                in the African diaspora.
