            <p class="lead">
                <strong>Hidden Collections Africa</strong> is a proposed new grant program aimed at the digital preservation of rare and unique collections, the advancement of African history and scholarship, and the expansion of online knowledge spaces for Africa. This program would support the description and digitization of materials held in African organizations that are currently inaccessible or at risk of being lost forever.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Led by African-based professionals, the program draws inspiration from CLIR's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections">large-scale grant programs</a> and will directly support institutions and staff across the continent to meet urgent preservation needs, close gabs in the historical record, and make records more accessible to users.

                The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights" target="_blank">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> asserts that access to information is a universal human right. It underpins social justice and facilitates informed decision making for planning, research, and development of humanity. In the 21st century, the availability of digital information has expanded many people's access to information for many. However, globally, Africa has the lowest number of accessible and available collections, both digital and print. Less than four percent of Africa's collections are available digitally. The limited availability of digital resources about and by Africans hinders egalitarian access to information and knowledge advancement on the continent. This is evidenced by duplication in research, inaccurate research conclusions, misguided policies, and the exclusion of some communities in research agendas. It also reduces the authenticity of history and intergenerational knowledge sharing.

                Meanwhile, collecting organizations in Africa face a number of urgent preservation challenges due to climate change and ongoing legacies of colonial exploitation. Rising sea levels, extreme heat, and aberrant weather patterns are on track to displace millions of people over the next several decades, increasing conflict and instability. Climate disasters, including fires, floods, desertification, and drought, threaten to obliterate these collections, some of which have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01045-4">already been lost</a>. Inventories and digital copies of collections are important safeguards to ensure that some versions of the materials held in African repositories will remain available for future generations.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5 mb-3 lh-lg">
                Africa's collections are mainly available in oral and traditional hard copy formats. This has been due to a lack of resources, both human skills and infrastructure. Critical holdings in need of digitization include content related to political movements and leadership, climate and environment, women and gender, indigenous languages, and innumerable other topics. Equitable access to these African collections will help inform decisions in civil society, religious groups, and other related communities.
